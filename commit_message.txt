Fix(backend): Resolve NullPointerException in AuthController

The `twoFactorEnabled` field in the `User` entity was a primitive `boolean`, which caused a `NullPointerException` when the corresponding database column was `NULL`.

This commit fixes the issue by:
- Changing the `twoFactorEnabled` field in the `User` entity to the `Boolean` wrapper class.
- Adding `@Column(name = "two_factor_enabled", nullable = false, columnDefinition = "BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE")` to the `twoFactorEnabled` field to enforce a non-null constraint and set a default value at the database level.
- Adding a test to verify the fix.
- Fixing the test by providing a valid email and role for the test user.
- Fixing the test by encoding the password before saving the user.
